<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>ON THE USE OF THE HOUR-GLASS IN PULPITS.</h3>

  <p>George Herbert says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The parson exceeds not an hour in preaching, because <i>all ages</i>
  have thought that a competency."&mdash;<i>A Priest to the Temple</i>, p.
  28.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Ferrarius, <i>De Ritu Concion.</i>, lib. i. c. 34., makes the
  following statement:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Huic igitur certo ac communi malo (the evil of too long sermons) ut
  medicinam facerent, Ecclesiæ patres in concionando determinatum dicendi
  tempus fereque unius horæ spatio conclusum aut ipsi sibi præscribant, aut
  ab aliis præfinitum religiosè observabant."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Bingham, commenting on this passage, observes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Ferrarius and some others are very positive that they (their sermons)
  were generally an hour long; but Ferrarius is at a loss to tell by what
  instrument they measured their hour, for he will not venture to affirm
  that they preached, as the old Greek and Roman orators declaimed, by an
  hour-glass."&mdash;See <i>Bingham</i>, vol. iv. p. 582.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This remark of Bingham's brings me at once to the subject of my
  present communication. What evidence exists of the practice of preaching
  by the hour-glass, thus treated as improbable, if not ridiculous, by the
  learned writer just quoted? If the early Fathers of the church
  <i>timed</i> their sermons by any instrument of the kind, we should
  expect their writings to contain <i>internal</i> evidence of the fact,
  just as frequent allusion is made by Demosthenes and other ancient
  orators to the klepshydra or water-clock, by which the time allotted to
  each speaker was measured. Besides, the close proximity of such an
  instrument would be a constant source of metaphorical allusion on the
  subject of <i>time and eternity</i>. Perhaps those of your readers who
  are familiar with the extant sermons of the Greek and Latin fathers, may
  be able to supply some illustration on this subject. At all events there
  appears to be indisputable evidence of the use of the hour-glass in the
  pulpit formerly in this country. <!-- Page 590 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page590"></a>{590}</span></p>

  <p>In an extract from the churchwardens' accounts of the parish of St.
  Helen, in Abingdon, Berks, we find the following entry:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Anno <span class="sc">mdxci.</span> 34 Eliz. 'Payde for an
  houre-glasse for the pulpit,' 4<i>d.</i>"&mdash;See Hone's
  <i>Table-Book</i>, vol. i. p. 482.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Among the accounts of Christ Church, St. Catherine's, Aldgate, under
  the year 1564, this entry occurs:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Paid for an hour-glass that hangeth by the pulpitt when the preacher
  doth make a sermon that he may know how the hour passeth
  away."&mdash;Malcolm's <i>Londinium</i>, vol. iii. p. 309., cited
  Southey's <i>Common-Place Book</i>, 4th Series, p. 471.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In Fosbrooke (<i>Br. Mon.</i>, p. 286.) I find the following
  passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"A stand for an hour-glass still remains in many pulpits. A rector of
  Bibury (in Gloucestershire) used to preach two hours, regularly turning
  the glass. After the text the esquire of the parish withdrew, smoaked his
  pipe, and returned to the blessing."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The authority for this, which Fosbrooke cites, is Rudder's
  <i>Gloucestershire</i>, in "Bibury." It is added that lecturers' pulpits
  have also hour-glasses The woodcuts in Hawkins's <i>Music</i>, ii. 332.,
  are referred to in support of this statement. I regret that I have no
  means of consulting the two last-mentioned authorities.</p>

  <p>In 1681 some poor crazy people at Edinburgh called themselves the
  Sweet Singers of Israel. Among other things, they renounced the limiting
  the Lord's mind by <i>glasses</i>. This is no doubt in allusion to the
  hour-glass, which Mr. Water, the editor of the fourth series of Southey's
  <i>Common-Place Book</i>, informs us is still to be found, or at least
  its iron frame, in many churches, adding that the custom of preaching by
  the hour-glass commenced about the end of the sixteenth century. I cannot
  help thinking that an earlier date must be assigned to this singular
  practice. (See Southey's <i>Common-Place Book</i>, 4th series, p. 379.)
  Mr. Water states that one of these iron frames still exists at Ferring in
  Sussex. The iron extinguishers still to be found on the railing opposite
  large houses in London, are a similar memorial of an obsolete custom.</p>

  <p>I trust some contributor to the "N. &amp; Q." will be able to supply
  farther illustrations of this custom. Should it be revived in our own
  times, I fear most parishes would supply only a <i>half</i>-hour glass
  for the pulpit of their church, however unanimous antiquity may be in
  favour of sermons of an hour's duration. One advantage presented by this
  ancient and precise practice was, that the squire of the parish knew
  exactly when it was time to put out his pipe and return for the blessing,
  which he cannot ascertain under the present uncertain and indefinite mode
  of preaching. Fosbrooke (<i>Br. Mon.</i>, p. 286.) states that the priest
  had sometimes a watch found for him by the parish. The authority cited
  for this is the following entry in the accounts of the Chantrey Wardens
  of the parish of Shire in Surrey:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Received for the priest's watch after he was dead, 13<i>s.</i>
  4<i>d.</i>"&mdash;Manning's <i>Surrey</i>, vol. i. p. 531.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This entry seems to be rather too vague and obscure to warrant the
  inference drawn from it. This also may be susceptible of farther
  illustration.</p>

<h3>THE MEGATHERIUM AMERICANUM IN THE BRITISH
MUSEUM.</h3>

  <p>Amongst the most interesting specimens of that collection certainly
  ranges the skeleton of the above animal of a primæval world, albeit but a
  cast; the real bones, found in Buenos Ayres, being preserved in the
  Museum of Madrid. To imagine a sloth of the size of a large bear,
  somewhat baffles our imagination; especially if we ponder upon the size
  of trees on which such a huge animal must have lived. To have placed near
  him a nondescript branch (!!) of a palm, as has been done in the Museum
  here, is a terrible mistake. Palms there were none at that period of
  telluric formation; besides, no sloth ever could ascend an exogenous
  tree, as the simple form of the coma of leaves precludes every hope of
  motion, &amp;c. I never can view those remnants of a former world,
  without being forcibly reminded of that most curious passage in Berosus,
  which I cite from memory:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"There was a flood raging then over parts of the world.... There were
  to be seen, however, on the walls of the temple of Belus, representations
  of animals, such as inhabited the earth before the Flood."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We may thence gather, that although the ancient world did not possess
  museums of stuffed animals, yet, the first collection of <i>Icones</i> is
  certainly that mentioned by Berosus. I think that it was about the times
  of the Crusades, that animals were first rudely preserved (stuffed),
  whence the emblems in the coats of arms of the nobility also took their
  origin. I have seen a MS. in the British Museum dating from this period,
  where the delineation of a bird of the <i>Picus</i> tribe is to be found.
  Many things which the Crusaders saw in Egypt and Syria were so striking
  and new to them, that they thought of means of preserving them as
  mementoes for themselves and friends. The above date, I think, will be an
  addition to the history of collections of natural history: a work wanting
  yet in the vast domain of modern literature.</p>

<h3>REMUNERATION OF AUTHORS.</h3>

  <p>In that varied and interesting of antiquarian and literary
  curiosities, "N. &amp; Q.," perhaps a collection of the prices paid by
  booksellers and publishers for works of interest and to authors of
  celebrity might find a corner. As a first contribution towards such a
  collection, if approved of, I send some Notes made some years ago, with
  the authorities from which I copied them. With regard to those cited on
  the authority of "R. Chambers," I cannot now say from which of Messrs.
  Chambers's publications I extracted them, but fancy it might have been
  the <i>Cyclopædia of English Literature</i>. To any one disposed to swell
  the list of the remunerations of authors, I would suggest that Disraeli's
  <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>, Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i>,
  Johnson's <i>Lives of the Poets</i> and other works of every-day
  handling, would no doubt furnish many facts; but all my books being in
  the country, I have no means of searching, and therefore send my Notes in
  the fragmentary state in which I find them:&mdash;</p>

<h3>COINCIDENT LEGENDS.</h3>

  <p>In the Scandinavian portion of the <i>Fairy Mythology</i>, there is a
  legend of a farmer cheating a Troll in an argument respecting the crops
  that were to be grown on the hill within which the latter resided. It is
  there observed that Rabelais tells the same story of a farmer and the
  Devil. I think there can be no doubt that these are not independent
  fictions, but that the legend is a transmitted one, the Scandinavian
  being the original, brought with them perhaps by the Normans. <!-- Page
  592 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page592"></a>{592}</span> But what
  are we to say to the actual fact of the same legend being found in the
  valleys of Afghánistán?</p>

  <p>Masson, in his <i>Narrative</i>, &amp;c. (iii. 297.), when speaking of
  the Tájiks of Lúghmân, says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"They have the following amusing story: In times of yore, ere the
  natives were acquainted with the arts of husbandry, the Shaitán, or
  Devil, appeared amongst them, and, winning their confidence, recommended
  them to sow their lands. They consented, it being farther agreed that the
  Devil was to be a <i>sherík</i>, or partner, with them. The lands were
  accordingly sown with turnips, carrots, beet, onions, and such vegetables
  whose value consists in the roots. When the crops were mature the Shaitán
  appeared, and generously asked the assembled agriculturists if they would
  receive for their share what was above ground or what was below. Admiring
  the vivid green hue of the tops, they unanimously replied that they would
  accept what was above ground. They were directed to remove their portion,
  when the Devil and his attendants dug up the roots and carried them away.
  The next year he again came and entered into partnership. The lands were
  now sown with wheat and other grains, whose value lies in their
  seed-spikes. In due time, as the crops had ripened, he convened the
  husbandmen, putting the same question to them as he did the preceding
  year. Resolved not to be deceived as before, they chose for their share
  what was below ground; on which the Devil immediately set to work and
  collected the harvest, leaving them to dig up the worthless roots. Having
  experienced that they were not a match for the Devil, they grew weary of
  his friendship; and it fortunately turned out that, on departing with his
  wheat, he took the road from Lúghmân to Báríkâb, which is proverbially
  intricate, and where he lost his road, and has never been heard of or
  seen since."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Surely here is simple coincidence, for there could scarcely ever have
  been any communication between such distant regions in remote times, and
  the legend has hardly been carried to Afghánistán by Europeans. There is,
  as will be observed, a difference in the character of the legends. In the
  Oriental one it is the Devil who outwits the peasants. This perhaps
  arises from the higher character of the Shaitán (the ancient Akriman)
  than that of the Troll or the mediæval Devil.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE READINGS, NO. VIII.</h3>

  <p>I have to announce the detection of an important misprint, which
  completely restores sense, point, and antithesis to a sorely tormented
  passage in <i>King Lear</i>; and which proves at the same time that the
  corrector of <span class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> folio, in this
  instance at least, is undeniably in error. Here, as elsewhere (whether by
  anticipation or imitation I shall not take upon me to decide), he has
  fallen into just the same mistake as the rest of the commentators: indeed
  it is startling to observe how regularly he suspects every passage that
  they have suspected, and how invariably he treats them in the same spirit
  of emendation (some places of course excepted, where his courage soars
  far beyond theirs; such as the memorable "curds and cream," "on a table
  of green frieze," &amp;c.).</p>

  <p>I say that the error of "the old corrector," in this instance, is
  <i>undeniable</i>, because the misprint I am about to expose, like the
  egg-problem of Columbus, when once shown, demonstrates itself: so that
  any attempt to support it by argument would be absurd, because
  superfluous.</p>

  <p>There are two verbs, one in every-day use, the other obsolete, which,
  although of nearly opposite significations, and of very dissimilar sound,
  nevertheless differ only in the mutual exchange of place in two letters:
  these verbs are <i>secure</i> and <i>r</i>ecu<i>s</i>e; the first
  implying <i>assurance</i>, the second <i>want of assurance</i>, or
  refusal. Hence any sentence would receive an opposite meaning from one of
  these verbs to what it would from the other.</p>

  <p>Let us now refer to the opening scene of the Fourth Act of <i>King
  Lear</i>, where the old man offers his services to Gloster, who has been
  deprived of his eyes:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Old Man.</i> You cannot see your way.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Gloster.</i> I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;</p>
      <p>I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen</p>
      <p>Our means <i>secure</i> us, and our mere defects</p>
      <p>Prove our commodities."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Here one would suppose that the obvious opposition between
  <i>means</i> and <i>defects</i> would have preserved these words from
  being tampered with; and that, on the other hand, the <i>absence</i> of
  opposition between <i>secure</i> and <i>commodious</i> would have
  directed attention to the real error. But, no: all the worretting has
  been about <i>means</i>; and this unfortunate word has been twisted in
  all manner of ways, until finally "the old corrector" informs us that
  "the printer read <i>wants</i> 'means,' and hence the blunder!"</p>

  <p>Now, mark the perfect antithesis the passage receives from the change
  of <i>secure</i> into <i>recuse</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i10">"Full oft 'tis seen</p>
      <p>Our means recuse us, and our mere defects</p>
      <p>Prove our commodities."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I trust I may be left in the quiet possession of whatever merit is due
  to this restoration. Some other of my humble <i>auxilia</i> have, before
  now, been coolly appropriated, with the most innocent air possible,
  without the slightest acknowledgment. One instance is afforded in <span
  class="sc">Mr. Keightley's</span> communication to "N. &amp; Q.," Vol.
  vii., p. 136., where that gentleman not only repeats the explanation I
  had previously given of the same passage, but even does me the honour of
  requoting the same line of Shakspeare with which I had supported it.</p>

  <p>I did not think it worth noticing at the time, nor should I now, were
  it not that <span class="sc">Mr. Keightley's</span> <!-- Page 593
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page593"></a>{593}</span> confidence in
  the negligence or want of recollection in your readers seems not have
  been wholly misplaced, if we may judge from <span class="sc">Mr.

<h3>SHAKESPEARE'S USE OF THE IDIOM "NO HAD" AND
"NO HATH NOT."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 520.)</p>

  <p>We are under great obligations to the <span class="sc">Rev. Mr.
  Arrowsmith</span> for his very interesting illustration of several
  misunderstood archaisms; and it may not be unacceptable to him if I call
  his attention to what seems to me a farther illustration of the above
  singular idiom, from Shakspeare himself.</p>

  <p>In <i>As You Like It</i>, Act I. Sc. 3., where Rosalind has been
  banished by the Duke her uncle, we have the following dialogue between
  Celia and her cousin:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Cel.</i> O my poor Rosalind! whither wilt thou go?</p>
      <p>Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.</p>
      <p>I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Ros.</i> I have more cause.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Cel.</i>                   Thou hast not, cousin:</p>
      <p>Pr'ythee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke</p>
      <p>Hath banish'd me, his daughter?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Ros.</i>                   That he hath not.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Cel.</i> <i>No hath not?</i> Rosalind lacks, then, the love</p>
      <p>Which teacheth thee that thou and I <i>are</i> one.</p>
      <p>Shall we be sunder'd," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>From wrong pointing, and ignorance of the idiomatic structure, the
  passage has hitherto been misunderstood; and Warburton proposed to read,
  "Which teacheth <i>me</i>," but was fortunately opposed by Johnson,
  although <i>he</i> did not clearly understand the passage. I have
  ventured to change <i>am</i> to <i>are</i>, for I cannot conceive that
  Shakspeare wrote, "that thou and I <i>am</i> one!" It is with some
  hesitation that I make this trifling innovation on the old text, although
  we have, a few lines lower, the more serious misprint of <i>your
  change</i> for <i>the charge</i>. I presume that the abbreviated form of
  <i>the = y<sup>e</sup></i> was taken for for <i>y<sup>r</sup></i>, and
  the <i>r</i> in <i>charge</i> mistaken for <i>n</i>; and in the former
  case of <i>am</i> for <i>are</i>, indistinctness in old writing, and
  especially in such a hand as, it appears from his autograph, our great
  poet wrote, would readily lead to such mistakes. That the correction was
  left to the printer of the first folio, I am fully persuaded; yet, in
  comparison with the second folio, it is a correct book, notwithstanding
  all its faults. That it was customary for men who were otherwise busied,
  as we may suppose Heminge and Condell to have been, to leave the
  correction entirely to the printer, is certain; for an acquaintance of
  Shakspeare's, Resolute John Florio, distinctly shows that it was the
  case. We have this pithy brief Preface to the second edition of his
  translation of Montaigne:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

<p class="cenhead">"<i>To the Reader.</i></p>

  <p>"Enough, if not too much, hath beene said of this translation. If the
  faults found even by myselfe in the first impression, be now by the
  printer corrected, as he was directed, the work is much amended: if not,
  know that through mine attendance on her Majesty, I could not intend it;
  and blame not Neptune for my second shipwracke. Let me conclude with this
  worthy man's daughter of alliance: 'Que t'ensemble donc lecteur?'</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>The Formation of the Woman</i>, Gen. ii. 21, 22.&mdash;The terms of
  Matthew Henry on this subject, in his learned <i>Commentary</i>, have
  become quite commonplace with divines, when speaking of the ordinance of
  marriage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The woman was made of a rib out of the side of Adam: not made out of
  his head, to top him; nor out of his feet, to be trampled upon by him;
  but out of his side, to be equal with him; under his arm, to be
  protected; and near his heart, to be beloved."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Like many other things in his Exposition, this is not original with
  Henry. It is here traced to the <i>Speculum Humanæ Salvationis</i> of the
  earliest and rarest printed works. Some of your readers can probably
  trace it to the Fathers. The verses which follow are engraven in block
  characters in the first edition of the work named, and are copied from
  the fifth plate of specimens of early typography in Meerman's <i>Origines

  governor of that province on March 1, 1733-4, "the day of the feast:"</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

<p class="cenhead">"To His Excellency Governor Johnson.</p>

<p class="cenhead">"The humble Petition of all the Maids whose names
are underwritten:</p>

  <p>"Whereas we the humble petitioners are at present in a very melancholy
  disposition of mind, considering how all the bachelors are blindly
  captivated by widows, and our more youthful charms thereby neglected: the
  consequence of this our request is, that your Excellency will for the
  future order that no widow shall presume to marry any young man till the
  maids are provided for; or else to pay each of them a fine for
  satisfaction, for invading our liberties; and likewise a fine to be laid
  on all such bachelors as shall be married to widows. The great
  disadvantage it is to us maids, is, that the widows, by their forward
  carriages, do snap up the young men; and have the vanity to think their
  merits beyond ours, which is a great imposition upon us who ought to have
  the preference.</p>

  <p>"This is humbly recommended to your Excellency's consideration, and
  hope you will prevent any farther insults.</p>

  <p>"And we poor Maids as in duty bound will ever pray.</p>

  <p>"P.S.&mdash;I, being the oldest Maid, and therefore most concerned, do
  think it proper to be the messenger to your Excellency in behalf of my
  fellow subscribers."</p>

  <p><i>Alison's "Europe."</i>&mdash;In a note to Sir A. Alison's
  <i>Europe</i>, vol. ix. p. 397., 12mo., enforcing the opinion that the
  prime movers in all revolutions are not men of high moral or intellectual
  qualities, he quotes, as from "Sallust <i>de Bello Cat.</i>,"</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"In <i>turbis atque seditionibus</i> pessimo cuique plurima vis; pax
  et quies bonis artibus <i>aluntur</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>No such words, however, are to be found in Sallust: but the correct
  expression is in Tacitus (<i>Hist.</i>, iv. 1.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Quippe in <i>turbas et discordias</i> pessimo cuique plurima vis; pax
  et quies bonis artibus <i>indigent</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sir A. Alison quotes, in the same note, as from Thucydides (l. iii. c.
  39.), the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"In the contests of the Greek commonwealth, those who were esteemed
  the most depraved, and had the least foresight, invariably prevailed; for
  being conscious of this weakness, and dreading to be overreached by those
  of greater penetration, they went to work hastily with the sword and
  poniard, and thereby got the better of their antagonists, who where
  occupied with more refined schemes."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This paragraph is certainly not in the place mentioned; nor can I find
  it after a diligent search through Thucydides. Will Sir A. Alison, or any
  of his Oxford friends, be good enough to point out the author, and
  indicate where such a passage is really to be found?</p>

  <p><i>"Bis dat, qui cito dat"</i> (Vol. vi., p. 376.).&mdash;<i>"Sat
  cito, si sat bene."</i>&mdash;The first of these proverbs reminded me of
  the second, which was a favourite maxim of Lord Chancellor Eldon. (See
  <i>The Life of Lord Chancellor Eldon</i>, vol. i. p. 48.) I notice it for
  the purpose of showing that Lord Eldon followed (perhaps unconsciously)
  the example of Augustus, and that the motto is as old as the time of the
  first Roman emperor, if it is not of more remote origin. The following is
  an extract from the Life of Augustus, Sueton., chap. <span

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>HOUSE-MARKS.</h3>

  <p>Are there traces in England of what the people of Germany, on the
  shores of the Baltic, call <i>Hausmärke</i>, and what in Denmark and
  Norway is called <i>bolmærke</i>, <i>bomærke</i>? These are certain
  figures, generally composed of straight lines, and imitating the shape of
  the cross or the runes, especially the so-called compound runes. They are
  meant to mark all sorts of property and chattels, dead and alive, movable
  and immovable, and are drawn out, or burnt into, quite inartistically,
  without any attempt of colouring or sculpturing. So, for instance, every
  freeholder in Praust, a German village near Dantzic, has his own mark on
  all his property, by which he recognises it. They are met with on
  buildings, generally over the door, or on the gable-end, more frequently
  on tombstones, or on epitaphs in churches, on pews and old screens, and
  implements, cattle, and on all sorts of documents, where the common
  people now use three crosses.</p>

  <p>The custom is first mentioned in the old Swedish law of the thirteenth
  century (Uplandslagh, <i>Corp. Jur. Sveo-Goth.</i>, iii. p. 254.), and
  occurs almost at the same period in the seals of the citizens of the
  Hanse-town Lubeck. It has been in common use <!-- Page 595 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page595"></a>{595}</span> in Norway, Iceland,
  Denmark, Sleswick, Holstein, Hamburgh, Lubeck, Mecklenburgh, and
  Pomerania, but is at present rapidly disappearing. Yet, in Holstein they
  still mark the cattle grazing on the common with the signs of their
  respective proprietors; they do the same with the haystacks in
  Mecklenburgh, and the fishing-tackle on the small islands of the Baltic.
  In the city of Dantzic these marks still occur in the prayer-books which
  are left in the churches.</p>

  <p>There are scarcely any traces of this custom in the south of Germany,
  except that the various towers of the city-wall of Nurnberg are said to
  bear their separate marks; and that an apothecary of Strasburg,
  Merkwiller, signs a document, dated 1521, with his name, his coat of
  arms, and a simple mark.</p>

  <p>Professor Homeyer has lately read, before the Royal Academy of Berlin,
  a very learned paper on the subject, and has explained this ancient
  custom as significant of popular law, possibly intimating the close
  connexion between the property and its owner. I am sorry not to be able
  to copy out the Professor's collection of runic marks; but I trust that
  the preceding lines will be sufficient in order to elicit the various
  traces of a similar custom still prevalent, or remembered, in the British
  isles; an account of which will be thankfully received at Berlin, where
  they have lately been informed, that even the eyder-geese on the
  Shetlands are distinguished by the marks of their owners.</p>

  <p><i>Anna Lightfoot.</i>&mdash;T.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;H. would be obliged by any
  particulars relating to Anna Lightfoot, the left-handed wife of George
  III. It has been stated that she had but one son, who died at an early
  age; but a report circulates in some channels, that she had also a
  daughter, married to a wealthy manufacturer in a midland town. It is
  particularly desired to know in what year, and under what circumstances,
  Anna Lightfoot died.</p>

  <p><i>Queries from the "Navorscher."</i>&mdash;Did Addison, Steele, or
  Swift write the "Choice of Hercules" in the <i>Tatler</i>?</p>

  <p><i>"Amentium haud Amantium."</i>&mdash;I should be glad to ascertain,
  and perhaps it may be interesting to classical scholars generally to
  know, if any of your correspondents or readers can suggest an English
  translation for the phrase "amentium haud amantium" (in the first act of
  the <i>Andria</i> of Terence), which shall represent the alliteration of
  the original. The publication of this Query may probably elicit the

  any reader of "N &amp; Q." who will supply the information. I make no
  doubt there are, in many of the private collections of this country,
  several portraits of officers so dressed, which have descended as
  heir-looms in families. I subjoin the colonels' names, and dates of the
  regiments:</p>

  <p><i>Raffaelle's Sposalizio.</i>&mdash;Will <span
  class="sc">Digitalis</span>, or any of your numerous correspondents or
  readers, do me the favour to say why, in Raffaelle's celebrated painting
  "Lo Sposalizio," in the gallery of the Brera at Milan, Joseph is
  represented as placing the ring on the third finger of <i>right</i> hand
  of the Virgin?</p>

  <p>I noticed the same peculiarity in Ghirlandais's fresco of the
  "Espousals" in the church of the Santa Croce at Florence. This I remarked
  to the custode, an intelligent old man, who informed <!-- Page 596
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page596"></a>{596}</span> me that the
  connexion said to exist between the heart and the third finger refers to
  that finger of the <i>right</i> hand, and not, as we suppose, to the
  third finger of the <i>left</i> hand. He added, that the English are the
  only nation who place the ring on the left hand. I do not find that this
  latter statement is borne out by what I have seen of the ladies of
  continental Europe; and I suppose it was an hallucination in my worthy
  informant.</p>

  <p>I must leave to better scholars in the Italian language than I am, to
  say whether "Lo Sposalizio" means "Betrothal" or "Marriage:" certainly
  this latter is the ordinary signification.</p>

  <p>I have a sort of floating idea that I once heard that at the ceremony
  of "Betrothal," now, I believe, rarely if ever practised, it was
  customary to place the ring on the right hand. I am by no means clear
  where I gleaned this notion.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

  <p><i>Form of Petition, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;May I request the insertion of
  a Query, requesting some of your readers to supply the <i>ellipsis</i> in
  the form with which petitions to Parliament are required to be closed,
  viz.: "And your petitioners will ever pray, &amp;c." To me, I confess,
  there appears to be something like impiety in its use in its present
  unmeaning state. Would a petition be rendered informal by any addition
  which would make it more comprehensible?</p>

  <p class="author">C. W. B.

<div class="note">
  <p>[The ellipsis appears to have varied according to circumstances: hence
  we find, in an original petition addressed to the Privy Council
  (apparently temp. Jac. I.), the concluding formula given at length
  thus:&mdash;"And yo<sup>r</sup> sup<sup>lt</sup>, as in all dutie
  bounden, shall daylie pray for your good L<sup>ps</sup>." Another
  petition, <span class="correction" title="'persented' in original"
  >presented</span> to Charles I. at Newark, <span class="sc">a.d.</span>
  1641, closes thus: "And your petitioners will ever pray for your
  Majesty's long and happy reign over us." Another, from the Mayor and
  Aldermen of London, in the same year: "And the petitioners, as in all
  duty bound, shall pray for your Majesty's most long and happy reign."
  Again, in the same year, the petition of the Lay-Catholic Recusants of
  England to the Commons closes thus: "And for so great a charity your
  humble petitioners <!-- Page 597 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page597"></a>{597}</span> shall ever (as in duty bound) pray for

<h3>PARISH REGISTERS.&mdash;RIGHT OF SEARCH.</h3>

  <p>In Vol. iv., p. 473. a Query on this subject is inserted, to which, in
  Vol. v., p. 37., <span class="sc">Mr. Chadwick</span> replied.</p>

  <p>The question, one of great importance to the genealogist, has recently
  been the subject of judicial decision, in the case of Steele <i>v.</i>
  Williams, reported in the 17th volume of the <i>Jurist</i>, p. 464. (the
  Number for Saturday, 28th May).</p>

  <p>At the opening of the argument, the Court of Exchequer decided that
  the fees, &amp;c. are regulated by the 6 &amp; 7 Will. IV. c. 86., "An
  Act for registering Births, Deaths, and Marriages in England," which in
  the 35th section enacts&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"That every rector, vicar, curate, and every registrar, registering
  officer, and secretary, who shall have the keeping, for the time being,
  of any register book of births, deaths, or marriages, shall at all
  reasonable times allow searches to be made of any register book in his
  keeping, and shall give a copy, certified under his hand, of any entry or
  entries in the same, on payment of the fee hereinafter mentioned; that is
  to say, for every search extending over a period not more than one year,
  the sum of 1<i>s.</i>, and 6<i>d.</i> additional for every additional
  year; and the sum of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for every single
  certificate."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Chadwick</span> seemed to consider this section
  only applied to "civil registration;" but this view is, I apprehend, now
  quite untenable.</p>

  <p>The case was, whether a parish clerk had a right to charge 2<i>s.</i>
  6<i>d.</i>, where the party searching the register did not require
  "certified copies," but only made his own extracts; <i>and it is decided
  he has no such right</i>.</p>

  <p>Mr. Baron Parke in his judgment says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"I think this payment was not voluntary, because the defendant" [the
  parish clerk] "told the plaintiff, that if he did not pay him for
  certificates, in all cases in which he wanted to make extracts, he should
  not make a search at all. <i>I think the plaintiff had at all events a
  right to make a search, and during that time make himself master, as he
  best might, of the contents of the book, and could not be prevented from
  so doing by the clerk</i> in whose custody they were; who in the present
  case insisted that if he wanted copies he must have certificates with the
  signature of the incumbent. For the 1<i>s.</i> he paid, the applicant had
  a right to look at all the names in one year. He had no right to remain
  an unreasonable time looking at the book; nor perhaps, strictly speaking,
  was the parish clerk bound to put it into his hands at all: for the clerk
  has a right to superintend everything done, and might fairly say to a
  man, 'Your hands are dirty: keep them in your pockets.' The applicant
  could therefore only exercise his right of search during a reasonable
  time, and make extracts that way. <i>If a man insists on taking himself a
  copy of anything in the books, that case is not provided for by the
  statute</i>: but if he requires a copy certified by the clergyman, then
  he must pay an additional fee for it.</p>

  <p>"It was consequently <i>an illegal act</i> in the defendant to insist
  that the plaintiff should pay 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for each entry in the
  book, of which he might choose to make an extract," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Baron Martin says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"With respect to the statute, counsel (Mr. Robinson) says, because
  taking extracts is not mentioned in the statute, it is competent for a
  parish clerk to take an extra payment for allowing them to be made. Where
  a man is allowed by statute to receive money, it is, as it were, by
  virtue of a contract that the statute makes for him, and he cannot make a
  contract for a different sum. The defendant here is bound by the entirety
  of the statute; <i>he may be paid for a search</i>, <span
  class="sc">or</span> <i>for a certified copy</i>, <span class="sc">but
  there is no intermediate course</span>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This decision will, I hope, have the effect of removing the
  difficulties so often experienced in making searches for genealogical
  purposes. At all events, the person making such search can now
  <i>safely</i> make his own notes, none daring <i>lawfully</i> to make him
  afraid. I have to apologise for the length of this letter.</p>

<h3>THE HONOURABLE MISS E. ST. LEGER, A FREEMASON.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iv., p. 234.)</p>

  <p>There is an inquiry in Vol. iv., p. 234., as to whether there is any
  truth in the story, that the Honourable Miss E. St. Leger was made a
  freemason; and as no account of the circumstances has yet appeared in
  your pages, I send you the following statement, which has been extracted
  from <i>The Patrician</i>. Apart from its value as a record of this
  singular fact, it contains other particulars which you may deem worthy of
  preservation in "N. &amp; Q."</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The Hon. Elizabeth St. Leger as the only female who was ever
  initiated into the ancient and honourable mystery of Freemasonry. How she
  obtained this honour we shall lay before our readers, having obtained the
  only genuine information from the best sources.</p>

  <p>"Lord Doneraile, Miss St. Leger's father, a very zealous mason, held a
  warrant, and occasionally opened Lodge at Doneraile House, his sons and
  some intimate friends assisting; and it is said that never were the
  masonic duties more rigidly performed than by the brethren of No. 150,
  the number of their warrant.</p>

  <p>"It appears that previous to the initiation of a gentleman to the
  first steps of masonry, Miss St Leger, <!-- Page 599 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page599"></a>{599}</span> who was a young girl,
  happened to be in an apartment adjoining the room generally used as a
  lodge-room; but whether the young lady was there by design or accident,
  we cannot confidently state. This room at the time was undergoing some
  alteration: amongst other things, the wall was considerably reduced in
  one part, for the purpose of making a saloon.</p>

  <p>"The young lady having heard the voices of the Freemasons, and
  prompted by the curiosity natural to all, to see this mystery so long and
  so secretly locked up from public view, she had the courage to pick a
  brick from the wall with her scissors, and witnessed the ceremony through
  the first two steps. Curiosity gratified, fear at once took possession of
  her mind; and those who understand this passage, well know what the
  feelings of any person must be who could unlawfully behold that ceremony.
  Let them then judge what were the feelings of a young girl, under such
  extraordinary circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Here was no mode of escape except through the very room where the
  concluding part of the second step was still being solemnised; and that
  being at the far end, and the room a very large one, she had resolution
  sufficient to attempt her escape that way, and with light but trembling
  step glided along unobserved, laid her hand on the handle of the door,
  and gently opening it, before her stood, to her dismay, a grim and surly
  <i>tiler</i>, with his long sword unsheathed. A shriek that pierced
  through the apartment alarmed the members of the lodge, who all rushing
  to the door, and finding that Miss St. Leger had been in the room during
  the ceremony, in the first paroxysm of their rage, it is said, her death
  was resolved upon; but from the moving and earnest supplication of her
  younger brother, her life was spared, on condition of her going through
  the two steps of the solemn ceremony she had unlawfully witnessed. This
  she consented to do, and they conducted the beautiful and terrified young
  lady through those trials which are sometimes more than enough for
  masculine resolution, little thinking they were taking into the bosom of
  their craft a member that would afterwards reflect a lustre on the annals
  of Masonry.</p>

  <p>"Miss St. Leger was directly descended from Sir Robert De St. Leger,
  who accompanied William the Conqueror to England, and was of that high
  repute that he, with his own hand, supported that prince when he first
  went out of his ship to land in Sussex.</p>

  <p>"Miss St. Leger was cousin to General Anthony St. Leger, Governor of
  St. Lucia, who instituted the interesting race and the celebrated
  Doncaster St. Leger stakes.</p>

  <p>"Miss St. Leger married Richard Aldworth, Esq., of Newmarket, a member
  of a highly honourable and ancient family, long celebrated for their
  hospitality and other virtues. Whenever a benefit was given at the
  theatres in Dublin or Cork for the Masonic Orphan Asylum, she walked at
  the head of the Freemasons, with her apron and other insignia of
  Freemasonry, and sat in the front row of the stage box. The house was
  always crowded on those occasions.</p>

  <p>"The portrait of this estimable woman is in the lodge room of almost
  every lodge in Ireland."</p>

<h3>WEATHER RULES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 522.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent J. A., jun., invites further contributions on the
  subject to which he refers. Though by no means infallible, such
  prognostics are not without a measure of truth, founded as they are on
  habits of close observation:</p>

  <div class="poem">

  </div>
  <p>To this I may add the French adage:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2">"Quel est Vendredi tel Dimanche."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>From a MS. now in my possession, dating two centuries back, I extract
  the following remarks on "Times and Seasons," as not wholly unconnected
  with the present subject:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Easter-day never falleth lower than the 22nd of March, and never
  higher than the 25th of April."</p>

  <p>"Shrove Sunday has its range between the 1st of February and the 7th
  of March."</p>

  <p>"Whit Sunday between the 10th of May and the 13th of June."</p>

  <p>"A rule of Shrovetide:&mdash;The Tuesday after the second change of
  the moon after New Year's-day is always Shrove Tuesday."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>To these I may perhaps be permitted to add certain cautions, derived
  frown the same source:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The first Monday in April, the day on which Cain was born, and Abel
  was slain.</p>

  <p>"The second Monday in August, on which day Sodom and Gomorrah were
  destroyed.</p>

  <p>"The 31st of December, on which day Judas was born, who betrayed
  Christ.</p>

  <p>"These are dangerous days to begin any business, fall sick, or
  undertake any journey."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We smile at the superstition which thus stamps these several periods
  as days of ill omen, especially when we reflect that farther inquiry
  would probably place every other day of the week under a like ban, and
  thus greatly impede the business of life&mdash;Friday, for instance,
  which, since our Lord's crucifixion on that day, we are strongly
  disinclined to make the starting-point of any new enterprise.</p>

  <p>In many cases this superstition is based on unpleasing associations
  connected with the days proscribed. Who can wonder if, in times less
  enlightened than our own, undue importance were attached to the strange
  coincidence which marked the deaths of Henry VIII. and his posterity.
  They all died on a Tuesday; himself on Tuesday, January 28, 1547; Edward

<h3>SCOTCHMEN IN POLAND.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 475.)</p>

  <p>In the debates about a union with Scotland in 1606, the
  "multiplicities of the Scots in Polonia" formed one of the arguments of
  the opposing party, who thought that England was likely to be overrun in
  a similar fashion. According to Wilson (<i>Hist. of James I.</i>, p.
  34.), the naturalisation of the Scots&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Was opposed by divers strong and modest arguments. Among which they
  brought in the comparison of Abraham and Lot, whose families joining,
  they grew to difference, and to those words, 'Vade tu ad dextram, et ego
  ad sinistram.' It was answered, That speech brought the captivity of the
  one; they having disjoined their strength. The party opposing said, If we
  admit them into our liberties, we shall be overrun with them; as cattle,
  naturally, pent up by a slight hedge, will over it into a better soil;
  and a tree taken from a barren place will thrive to excessive and
  exuberant branches in a better,&mdash;witness the <i>multiplicities of
  the Scots in Polonia</i>.</p>

  <p>"To which it was answered, That if they had not means, place, custom,
  and employment (not like beasts, but men), they would starve in a
  plentiful soil, though they came into it. And what springtide and
  confluence of that nation have housed and familied themselves among us,
  these four years of the king's reign? And they will never live so meanly
  here as they do in Polonia; for they had rather discover their poverty
  abroad than at home."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This last "answerer" was Lord Bacon. In his speech "Of general
  Naturalisation" (<i>Works</i>, vol. v. p. 52.), he asserts that the
  "multiplication of Scots in Polonia" must of necessity be imputed</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"To some special accident of time and place that draws them thither;
  for you see plainly before your eyes, that in Germany, which is much
  nearer, and in France, where they are invited with privileges, and with
  this very privilege of naturalisation, yet no such number can be found;
  so as it cannot either be nearness of place, or privilege of person, that
  is the cause."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>What these "special accidents" were, it would be interesting to
  ascertain. Large bodies of men were levied in Scotland during the latter
  half of the sixteenth century, for the service of Sweden, and employed in
  the Polish wars. Can these have turned merchants, or induced others to
  follow them? In 1573, Charles de Mornay brought 5000 Scots to Sweden. In
  1576, whilst they were serving in Livonia, a quarrel broke out between
  them and a body of Germans also in the Swedish pay, and 1500 Scots were
  cut down. (<i>Geiger</i>, ch. xii.)</p>

  <p>I believe <span class="sc">Mr. Cunningham</span> will find some
  notices of Scottish merchants in Poland in Lithgow's <i>Travels</i>,
  which I have not at present by me.</p>

<h3>MR. JUSTICE NEWTON.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 528.)</p>

  <p>Sir Richard Newton was Chief Justice of the Common Pleas from 1438 to
  1444, and died Dec. 13th, 1444, and was buried in a chapel of Bristol
  Cathedral. (Collins's <i>Baronage</i>, vol. iii. p. 145.) He assumed the
  name of Newton, instead of Caradoc, from Newton in Powysland.
  (Collinson's <i>Somersetshire</i>, East Harptrie); and, as Camden, p.
  60., says, the Newtons "freely own themselves to be of Welsh extraction,
  and not long ago to have been called Caradocks." These Caradocs were
  descended from the ancient kings of Wales. Sir Richard Newton was twice
  married: 1. to a daughter of Newton, of Crossland; and 2. to Emmett,
  daughter of John Harvey, of London, according to a MS. in the British
  Museum; but, according to Somersetshire and Gloucestershire Visitations,
  to Emma, daughter of Sir Thomas Perrott, of Islington. He had issue by
  both marriages, and from the second descended Sir John Newton, who was
  created a baronet 12 Car. II., and died in 1661. The baronetcy was
  limited in remainder, at its creation, to John Newton, of Hather, in
  Lincolnshire, and he became the second baronet. There are several
  pedigrees tracing the descent from Sir Richard to the first baronet; but
  I have not yet seen the descent to the second baronet, though there can
  be no doubt that he was also descended from Sir Richard, otherwise the
  baronetcy could not have been limited to him; and probably he was the
  next male heir of the first baronet, as that is the usual mode of
  limiting titles. In the Heralds' College there is a pedigree of Sir Isaac
  Newton, signed by himself, in which he traces his descent to the brother
  of the ancestor of the second baronet. It should seem, therefore, that
  Sir Isaac was himself descended from the Chief Justice. It would confer a
  great obligation on the writer if any of your readers could afford any
  assistance to clear up the pedigree of the second baronet.</p>

  <p>As to the representatives of Sir Richard, I doubt whether his heir is
  discoverable, although there are many descendants now living who trace
  their descent through females.</p>

<h3>THE MARRIAGE RING.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 332.)</p>

  <p>I cannot agree with the answer given, under the above reference, to
  the question of J.&nbsp;P.: "How did the use of the ring, in the marriage
  ceremony, originate?" The answer given is taken from Wheatly's
  <i>Rational Illustration</i>, &amp;c., and is in substance
  this:&mdash;The ring anciently was a <i>seal</i>, and the delivery of
  this seal was a sign of confidence; and as a ceremony in marriage, its
  signification is, that the wife is admitted to the husband's counsels.
  From this argument, and the supposed proofs of it, I beg to dissent; and
  I conceive that Wheatly has not thrown any light upon the origin of this
  beautiful ceremony. To bear out his view, it would be necessary to prove
  that a signet ring had originally been used for the wedding ring&mdash;a
  matter of no slight difficulty, not to say impossibility.</p>

  <p>What I take to be the real meaning of the ring as a part of the
  marriage ceremony, I will now give. It has a far higher meaning in the
  ceremony, and a more important duty to perform than merely to signify the
  admission of the wife into the counsels of the husband. Its office is to
  teach her the duty she owes to her husband, rather than the privilege of
  admission into his counsels. The ring is a preacher, to teach her lessons
  of holy wisdom referring to her state of life.</p>

  <p>A ring, whenever used by the church, signifies, to use the words of
  liturgical writers, "integritatem fidei," the perfection of fidelity, and
  is "fidei sacramentum," the badge of fidelity. Its form, having no
  beginning and no end, is the emblem of eternity, constancy, integrity,
  fidelity, &amp;c.; so that the wedding ring symbolises the eternal or
  entire fidelity the wife pledges to her husband, and she wears the ring
  as the badge of this fidelity. Its office, then, is to teach and
  perpetually remind her of the fidelity she owes to her husband, and swore
  to him at the marriage ceremony.</p>

  <p>The wedding ring is to the wife precisely what the episcopal ring is
  to the bishop, and <i>vice versâ</i>. The language used during the
  ceremony to the one is very similar to that used to the other, as the
  object of the ceremony and use of the ring is the same. A bishop's ring,
  as we read, signifies "integritatem fidei," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> that he should
  love as himself the church of God committed to him as his bride. When he
  receives the ring at his consecration, the words used are, "Accipe
  annulum, <i>fidei scilicet signaculum</i>, quatenus sponsam Dei, sanctum
  videlicet ecclesiam, intemerata fide ornatus illibate custodias:"
  (Receive the ring, the badge of fidelity, to the end that, adorned with
  inviolable fidelity you may guard without reproach the spouse of God,
  that is, His Holy Church).</p>

  <p>Hence the office of the episcopal ring throws light upon the office of
  the wedding ring; and there can be no doubt whatever that its real
  meaning is, in the latter as in the former case, to signify the
  <i>eternal fidelity and constancy</i> that should subsist between the
  married couple.</p>

  <p>That this is the correct view of the meaning of the wedding ring is
  farther confirmed by the prayer used in blessing the ring: "Benedic,
  Domine, annulum hunc ... ut quæ eum gestaverit, <i>fidelitatem
  integram</i> suo sponso tenens, in pace et voluntate tua permaneat, acque
  in mutua charitate semper vivat."&mdash;<i>Rituale</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>CANADA, ETC.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 380. 504.)</p>

  <p>My former Note on the origin of this name suggests a question, which,
  if you think it worthy of a place in "N. &amp; Q.," may interest many
  besides myself, viz. At what period and by whom was that part of North
  America called Canada?</p>

  <p>To the French it appears always to have been known as "La Nouvelle
  France." La Hontan, who quitted the country 1690, I think, calls it
  Canada. Lajitan certainly does, as well as many other old authors.</p>

  <p>In a map of North America, date 1769, the tract bordering on the St.
  Lawrence, lately called Upper and Lower Canada, is designated "The
  Province of Quebec;" whilst the region to the northward, lying between it
  and Hudson's Bay, has the word Canada in much larger letters, as if a
  general name of the whole. That the name is slightly altered from an
  Indian word is probable, but not so that it was used by the Indians
  themselves, who, in the first place, were not in the habit of imposing
  general names on large districts, although they had significant ones for
  almost every locality; the former were usually denominated the land of
  the Iroquois, of the Hurons, &amp;c., <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> of the people
  dwelling, on, and in possession of it. Even allowing that the Indians may
  have had a general name for the country, it is very unlikely that one so
  unmeaning as "Kanata" would have been imposed upon it by a people whose
  nomenclature in every other case is so full of meaning.</p>

  <p>Moreover, although the Mic-macs of Gaspé may have called themselves
  Canadians according to Lescarbot, yet we are told by Volney,
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The Canadian savages call themselves 'Metoktheniakes' (born of the
  sun), without allowing themselves to be persuaded of the contrary by the
  Black Robes," &amp;c.&mdash;Vol. ii. p. 438.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following, to the same purpose, is from the <i>Quarterly
  Review</i>, vol. iv. p. 463.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"'Tapoy,' which we understand from good authority to be the generic
  appellation by which the North American tribes distinguish themselves
  from the whites," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 602 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page602"></a>{602}</span></p>

  <p>Now I should imagine both Lescarbot and Champlain, knowing nothing of
  the language, and probably having very bad interpreters, must have made a
  great mistake in supposing the Gaspésiens called themselves Canadians,
  for I have questioned several intelligent Mic-Macs on the subject, and
  they have invariably told me that they call themselves "Ulnookh" or
  "Elnouiek," "<i>Ninen elnouiek!&mdash;We are Men.</i>" But Mic-mac? "O,
  Mic-mac all same as Ulnookh." The latter word strictly means Indian-man,
  and cannot be applied to a white. Mic-mac is the name of their tribe,
  and, they insist upon it, always has been. Again, Kanata is said to be an
  Iroquois word, and, consequently, not likely to have been in use amongst
  a tribe of the Lenape family, which the Mic-macs are. It does not appear
  that we have any authority for supposing the country was ever called
  Canada by the Indians themselves.</p>

  <p>It is curious enough that as Canada was said to derive from an
  exclamation, "Acá nada!" so the capital has been made to take its name
  from another; "Quel bec!" cried one of Champlain's Norman followers, on
  beholding Cape Diamond. As in the former case, however, so in this, we
  have evidence of more probable sources of the name, which I will
  enumerate as briefly as possible. The first, and a very probable one, is
  the fact, that the strait between Quebec and St. Levi side of the river,
  was called in the Algonquin language "Quebeio," <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a
  narrowing,&mdash;a most descriptive appellation, for in ascending the
  river its breadth suddenly diminishes here from about two miles to
  fourteen or fifteen hundred yards from shore to shore.</p>

  <p>The little river St. Charles, which flows into the St. Lawrence on the
  northern side of the promontory, is called in the Indian language
  (Algonquin?) Kabir or Koubac, significant of its tortuous course, and it
  is from this, according to La Potherie, that the city derives its name of
  Quebec.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hawkins, in his <i>Picture of Quebec, &amp;c., 1834</i>, denies
  the Indian origin of the word, since, as he says, there is no analogous
  sound to it in any of their languages; and he assumes a Norman origin for
  it on the strength of "Bec" being always used by the Normans to designate
  a promontory in the first place; and secondly, because the word Quebec is
  actually found upon a seal of the Earl of Suffolk, of historical
  celebrity temp. Hen. V. and VI., which Mr. Hawkins supposes to have been
  the name of some town, castle, or barony in Normandy.</p>

  <p>Such are the pros and cons, upon which I do not presume to offer any
  opinion; only I would observe, that if there are no analogous sounds in
  the Indian languages, whence come Kennebec and other similar names?</p>

  <p class="address">Exeter.

  <p>Surely in the "inscription on a seal (1420), in which the Earl of
  Suffolk is styled 'Domin<i>e</i> [?] de Hamburg et de Quebec,'" the last
  word must be a misprint for <i>Lubec</i>, the sister city of Hamburg.
  <span class="sc">Mr. Hawkins's</span> etymology seems to rest on no more
  substantial foundation than an error of the press in the work, whichever
  that may be, from which he quotes.</p>

<h3>SELLING A WIFE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 429.)</p>

  <p>The popular idea that a man may legally dispose of his wife, by
  exposing her for sale in a public market, may not improbably have arisen
  from the correlation of the terms <i>buying</i> and <i>selling</i>. Your
  correspondent <span class="sc">V.&nbsp;T. Sternberg</span> need not be
  reminded how almost universal was the custom among ancient nations of
  purchasing wives; and he will admit that it appears natural that the
  commodity which has been obtained "per æs et libram"&mdash;to use the
  phrase of the old Roman law touching matrimony&mdash;is transferable to
  another for a similar consideration, whenever it may have become useless
  or disagreeable to its original purchaser. However this may be, the
  custom is ancient, and moreover appears to have obtained, to some extent,
  among the higher orders of society. Of this an instance may be found in
  Grimaldi's <i>Origines Genealogicæ</i>, pp. 22, 23. (London, 1828, 4to.)
  The deed, by which the transaction was sought to be legalised, runs as
  follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"To all good Christians to whom this writ shall come, John de Camoys,
  son and heir of Sir Ralph de Camoys, greeting: Know me to have delivered,
  and yielded up of my own free will, to Sir William de Paynel, Knight, my
  wife Margaret de Camoys, daughter and heiress of Sir John de Gatesden;
  and likewise to have given and granted to the said Sir William, and to
  have made over and quit-claimed all goods and chattels which the said
  Margaret has or may have, or which I may claim in her right; so that
  neither I, nor any one in my name, shall at any time hereafter be able to
  claim any right to the said Margaret, or to her goods and chattels, or
  their pertinents. And I consent and grant, and by this writ declare, that
  the said Margaret shall abide and remain with the said Sir William during
  his pleasure. In witness of which I have placed my seal to this deed,
  before these witnesses: Thomas de Depeston, John de Ferrings, William de
  Icombe, Henry le Biroun, Stephen Chamberlayne, Walter le Blound, Gilbert
  de Batecumbe, Robert de Bosco, and others."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This matter came under the cognisance of Parliament in 1302, when the
  grant was pronounced to be invalid.</p>

  <p>Now, we may fondly believe that this transaction, which occurred five
  hundred and fifty years ago, was characteristic alone of that dark and
  distant period, and that no parallel can be found in modern <!-- Page 603
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page603"></a>{603}</span> times (at
  least in a decent class of society, and recognised by legal sanction) to
  justify the lively French dramatists in seizing upon it as a trait of
  modern English manners. A transaction, however, came before the public
  eye a month or two ago, which, should you think the following record of
  it worth preservation as a "curiosity of legal experience," may lead your
  readers to a different conclusion:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"A young man, named W.&nbsp;C. Capas, was charged at the Public Office,
  Birmingham, Jan. 31, 1853, with assaulting his wife. The latter, in
  giving her evidence, stated that her husband was not living with her, but
  was 'leased' to another female. Upon inquiry by the magistrate into this
  novel species of contract, the document itself was produced in court, and
  read. It ran as follows:</p>

  <p>"'Memorandum of agreement made and entered into this second day of
  October, in the year of our Lord 1852, between William Charles Capas, of
  Charles-Henry Street, in the borough of Birmingham, in the county of
  Warwick, carpenter, of the one part, and Emily Hickson, of Hurst Street,
  Birmingham aforesaid, spinster, of the other part. Whereas the said
  William Charles Capas and Emily Hickson have mutually agreed with each
  other to live and reside together, and to mutually assist in supporting
  and maintaining each other during the remainder of their lives, and also
  to sign the agreement hereinafter contained to that effect: now,
  therefore, it is hereby mutually agreed upon, by and between the said
  William Charles Capas and Emily Hickson, that they the said, &amp;c.,
  shall live and reside together during the remainder of their lives, and
  that they shall mutually exert themselves by work and labour, and by
  following all their business pursuits, to the best of their abilities,
  skill, and understanding, and by advising and assisting each other, for
  their mutual benefit and advantage, and also to provide for themselves
  and each other the best supports and comforts of life which their means
  and income may afford. And for the true and faithful performance of this
  agreement, each of the said parties bindeth himself and herself unto the
  other finally by this agreement, as witness the hands of the said
  parties, this day and year first above written."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here follow the signatures of the consenting parties. The girl Hickson
  was examined, and admitted that she had signed the document at the office
  of a Mr. Campbell, the <i>lawyer</i>(!) who prepared it, and that his
  charge for drawing up the same was, she believed, 1<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i>
  The latter promised her, at the same time, that if the wife of Capas gave
  her any annoyance he would put in that paper as evidence. The
  magistrates, considering the assault proved, fined Capas 2<i>s.</i>
  6<i>d.</i>, and "commented in very strong terms on the document which had
  that day been brought before them." (See <i>Birmingham Journal</i>, Jan.
  5th, 1853.) Has a similar transaction come before the notice of your
  correspondents?</p>

  <p>I may add that we are informed by the <i>Birmingham Argus</i> for
  March, 1834, that in that month a man led his wife by a halter to
  Smithfield Market in that town, and there publicly offered her for
  sale.</p>

<h3>ENOUGH.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 455.)</p>

  <p>This word, when written or pronounced <i>enow</i>, is regarded as a
  plural, and relates to <i>number</i>. In this sense it is employed in
  Northampton and other Midland counties, and is found in old writers. If
  the word was always pronounced <i>enow</i>, it must be long since. The
  distinction above hinted at prevailed in Waller's time, and he conforms
  to it in the examples quoted. Butler, in <i>Hudibras</i>, has both:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"This b'ing professed we hope <i>enough</i>,</p>
      <p>And now go on where we left off.'</p>
      <p class="i8">Part i. canto 2. 44.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Again, line 1153. of the same canto:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"For though the body may creep through,</p>
      <p>The hands in grate are <i>enough</i>;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>an apparent exception, but not really such. (See also canto 3. 117.
  285., where it rhymes with "off," as also line 809. At line 739. it
  written <i>enow</i>, and rhymes with "blow.")</p>

  <p>And again, 873:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"My loss of honour's great <i>enough</i>,</p>
      <p>Thou needst not brand it with a scoff."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Other examples may be quoted from the same author.</p>

  <p>In a song, written upon the Restoration of Charles II., we have the
  following:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Were not contented, but grew rough,</p>
      <p>As though they had not won <i>enough</i>."</p>
      <p class="i8"><i>Loyal Arms</i>, vol. i. p. 244.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the <i>Lamentable Tragedy of Cambises</i>, written early in the
  reign of Elizabeth, the word occurs:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Gogs sides, knaves, seeing to fight ye be so rough,</p>
      <p>Defend yourselves, for I will give ye bothe <i>inough</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In <i>Lusty Juventus, a Morality</i>, temp. Edward VI., is the
  following:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Call them Papistes, hipocrites, and joyning of the plough;</p>
      <p>Face out the matter, and then good <i>ynough</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Here certainly the distinction disappears, as in the next and last
  example from <i>Candlemas Day</i>, "Ao. Do. 1512," where Joseph is
  speaking:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Take hym in your armys, Mary, I you pray,</p>
      <p>And of your swete mylke let him sowke <i>inowe</i>,</p>
      <p>Mawger Herowd and his grett fray:</p>
      <p>And as your spouse, Mary, I shall go with you."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It would seem therefore, that this word has had its present
  pronunciation about three centuries. <!-- Page 604 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page604"></a>{604}</span> Its derivation is
  directly from the Saxon <i>genoh</i>, but the root is found in many other
  languages, as the German, Dutch, Danish, &amp;c.</p>

  <p class="author">B. H. C.

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Wright</span> supposes there has been a change in
  the pronunciation of this word, and inquires when it took place. Now, if
  my conjecture be correct, there may have been no change, and these are
  two words,&mdash;not one pronounced differently. Both the instances
  quoted by him are in conformity with my opinion, viz. that where the
  sense is "a sufficient <i>quantity</i>," either in substance, quality, or
  action, we should make use of <i>enough</i>; yet where a sufficient
  <i>number</i> is intended, we should pronounce and write <i>enow</i>. I
  recollect (being a native of Suffolk) that I was laughed at by the boys
  of a school in a western county, nearly seventy years ago: but I was not
  then laughed out of my word, nor am I likely now to be argued out of
  it.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;I see that Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i> gives the same
  statement about <i>enough</i> and <i>enow</i>. This answer is therefore
  superfluous. Johnson gives numerous instances of the use of <i>enow</i>
  from our best authors.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Mr. Wilkinson's Mode of levelling Cameras.</i>&mdash;As you have
  done me the honour to notice my simple invention for levelling cameras,
  which I have since had an opportunity of trying in the open air for a
  week, and find to succeed perfectly, I wish to correct some errors which
  appeared in the <i>Photographic Journal</i>, from which you copied my
  remarks, and which arose from the notes being taken down from my verbal
  observations. The first part is perfectly correct but after l. 9. col. 2.
  "N. &amp; Q." (Vol. vii., p. 462.) it should read thus:</p>

  <p>"The other perpendicular is then sought for; the back or front of the
  camera being raised or lowered until the thread cuts the perpendicular
  lines drawn upon the sides of the camera. By this means a perfectly
  horizontal plane is obtained, as true as with the best spirit-levels, and
  in less time. By tying three knots in the silk at twelve inches distance
  from the one bullet and from each other, we have a measure for
  stereoscopic pictures; and by making the thread thirty-nine inches and
  two-tenths long from one bullet to the centre of the other, we obtain a
  pendulum vibrating seconds, which is useful in talking portraits; as it
  will continue vibrating for ten minutes, if one bullet be merely hung
  over any point of suspension."</p>

  <p>Thus we obtain a levelling instrument, a chronometer, and a measure of
  distances, at a cost considerably under one penny.</p>

  <p>The above will more fully explain to your correspondent <span
  class="grk">&Phi;</span>. (Vol. vii., p. 505.) my reasons for the length
  of thread stated; and with respect to the diagonal lines on the ground
  glass, it is not material what may be the distance of the principal
  object, whether six feet or six hundred: for if the cross lines, or any
  other lines drawn on the glass, cut the central object in the picture at
  any particular part&mdash;for example, the window of any particular
  house, or the branch of any tree,&mdash;then the camera may be removed to
  higher or lower ground, several feet or inches, to the right or to the
  left, and the same lines be made to cut the same objects, previously
  noted; the elevation will then be the same, which completes all that is
  required.</p>

  <p>In most stereoscopic pictures, the distances are too wide. For a
  portrait, two inches and half to three inches, at nine or twelve feet
  distant, is enough; and for landscapes much less is required than is
  generally given, for no very great accuracy is necessary. Three feet, at
  three hundred yards, is quite enough; and four to six feet, at a mile,
  will do very well. Let experiment determine: for every photographer must
  learn his profession or amusement; there is no royal road to be depended
  on. But a small aperture, a quarter of an inch diameter, may be
  considered a good practical size for a lens of three and a quarter
  inches, depending on light and time: the smaller the aperture, the longer
  the time; and no rules can be given by any one who does not know the size
  and quality of the lenses employed. Every one can make a few trials for
  himself, and find it out; which will be more satisfactory than any
  instructions derived from books or correspondence. I obtain all the
  information I can from every source, then try, and judge for myself. At
  worst, you only spoil a few sheets of paper, and gain experience.</p>

  <p>I perfectly agree with <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>, that it is
  much better not to wash the collodion pictures after developing; but pour
  on about one drachm of sat. sol. hypo. at once, and then, when clear,
  plenty of water; and let water rest on the surface for an hour or more,
  before setting on edge to dry.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Henry Wilkinson.</span>

  <p><i>Collodion Negative.</i>&mdash;Can you inform me how a collodion
  negative may be made? that is, how you can ensure the negative being
  always of a <i>dense enough character to print from</i>. This is rarely
  the case.</p>

  <p class="author">F. M.

  <p><i>Developing Collodion Process.</i>&mdash;I use to develope my
  collodion pictures M. Martin's plan, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> a solution of common
  copperas made a little acid with sulphuric acid. This answers very well
  and gives to the pictures, after they have been exposed an hour or two to
  the atmosphere, a silver-like appearance: but this copperas solution
  seems to destroy the <i>glass</i> for using <i>a second time</i>,
  inasmuch as a haziness is cast upon the glass, and its former enamel
  seems lost, not to be regained even by using acids. The hyposulphite also
  seems to be affected by this manner of developing the <!-- Page 605
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page605"></a>{605}</span> pictures
  after a short time, which is not the case with pyrogallic acid. The
  hypo., when thus affected with the copperas, appears also to throw a mist
  over the picture, which new hypo. does <i>not</i>. I should esteem it a
  favour if any of your numerous readers could inform me the cause of
  this.</p>

  <p class="author">A. A. P.

  <p><i>An iodizing Difficulty.</i>&mdash;May I request the favour, from
  some one of your numerous photographic correspondents, of a solution to
  the following apparent enigma, through the medium of "N. &amp; Q."?</p>

  <p>Being located in a neighbourhood where there is a scarcity of water in
  the summer months, I lately took advantage of a pool in a running stream,
  which ran at the bottom of the grounds of a friend, to soak my calotype
  papers in, subsequent to having brushed them over with the solution of
  iodide of silver, according to the process recommended by <span
  class="sc">Sir W. Newton</span>. One-half of the batch was removed in
  about two hours and a half, being beautifully clean, and of a nice light
  primrose colour; and in consequence of an unexpected call and detention
  longer than I had anticipated, the other half was left floating from two
  o'clock <span class="sc">p.m.</span> until seven or eight in the evening
  (nearly six hours), when, much to my chagrin, I found on their removal
  that they had all, more or less, become browned, or, rather, had taken on
  a dirty, deep, nankeen colour, those that had been first floated being
  decidedly the worst. I had previously thought that the papers <i>must</i>
  be left <i>at least</i> two and a half to three hours, a longer period
  having no other effect than that of softening the papers, or, at most, of
  allowing some slight portion of the iodide to fall off from their
  surface, whereas, from the above-described discoloration, an evident
  decomposition must have commenced, which I am quite at a loss to account
  for; neither can I conjecture what the chemical change can have been. I
  have several times before prepared good papers in trays filled with water
  from the same stream, but from the quantity running in the brook in the
  spring months, I never before have had the chance of floating them in the
  stream itself.</p>

  <p>An explanation of the above difficulty from some obliging and
  better-informed photographist would be very thankfully received by</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Henry H. Hele.</span>

  <p class="address">Ashburton, Devon.

  <p>P.S.&mdash;The pool of water was well shaded, consequently not a ray
  of bright sunlight could possibly impinge on the papers while
  floating.</p>

  <p>I have always understood that <i>pure</i> iodide of silver was quite
  insensible to the action of light, or to any other chemical change, as
  far as the action of atmospheric air was concerned.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Bishop Frampton</i> (Vol. iii., p 261.).&mdash;For some account of
  this excellent man, see chapter xxxi. of Mr. Anderdon's <i>Life of Bishop
  Ken</i>, where are given some very interesting letters, that are printed
  from the MSS. in the possession of Dr. Williams, Warden of New College,
  Oxford. Frampton appears to have been at one time chaplain to the British
  Factory at Aleppo. Mandeville, in the Dedication prefixed to his
  <i>Journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem</i>, makes honourable mention of him,
  and attributes the highly creditable character of the society to the
  influence of that incomparable instructor. When the funeral procession of
  Christian, Countess of Devonshire, halted at Leicester, on the way to
  Derby, a sermon was preached on the occasion by Frampton, who was then
  chaplain to the Earl of Elgin, the Countess's near relative. In sending
  these scraps, allow me to express the hope that <span class="sc">Mr.
  Evans</span> has not laid aside his intention of favouring us with a Life
  of Frampton.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[We cordially join in the wish expressed by our correspondent, that
  the Vicar of Shoreditch will before long favour us with the publication
  of the manuscript life of this amiable prelate, written, we believe, by
  his chaplain. It appears to us doubtful whether the bishop ever published
  any of his sermons, from what he states in a letter given in the Appendix
  to <i>The Life of John Kettlewell</i>. "I have often," he says, "been in
  the pulpit, in season and out of season, and also bold and honest enough
  there, God be praised; but never in the <i>printing-house</i> yet; and
  believe I never shall be." The longest printed account of this deprived
  bishop is given in Rudder's <i>History and Antiquities of Gloucester</i>;
  and no doubt many particulars respecting him and other Nonjurors may be
  found in the Rawlinson MSS. in the Bodleian Library.]</p>

  <p><i>Parochial Libraries</i> (Vol. vi., p. 432; Vol. vii.
  <i>passim</i>).&mdash;At Dunblane the collection of books bequeathed by
  the amiable Leighton is still preserved. At All Saints,
  Newcastle-on-Tyne, I once saw, among some old books in the vestry, a
  small quarto volume of tracts, including Archbishop Laud's speech in the
  Star Chamber, at the censure of Bastwick, Burton, and Prynne. It had been
  presented by the Rev. E. Moise, M.&nbsp;A., many years lecturer of that
  church.</p>

  <p>The old library at St. Nicholas, Newcastle-on-Tyne, contains many
  curious books and MSS., particularly the old Bible belonging to Hexham
  Abbey. This library was greatly augmented by the munificent bequest of
  the Rev. Dr. Thomlinson, rector of Whickham, prebendary of St. Paul's,
  and lecturer of St. Nicholas, who died at an advanced age, in 1748,
  leaving all his books to this church. In 1825 Archdeacon Bowyer presented
  a series of lending libraries&mdash;ninety-three in all&mdash;to the
  several parishes in the county of Northumberland. <!-- Page 606 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page606"></a>{606}</span> They are in the
  custody of the incumbent for the time being. Lastly, there is a very
  valuable library at Bamburgh Castle, the bequest of Dr. Sharp: the books
  are allowed to circulate gratuitously amongst the clergy and respectable
  inhabitants of the adjoining neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>The Honourable Mrs. Dudleya North died in 1712. Her choice collection
  of books in oriental learning were "by her only surviving brother, the
  then Lord North and Grey, given to the parochial library at Rougham, in
  Norfolk, founded by the Hon. Roger North, Esq., for the use of the
  minister of that parish, and, under certain regulations and restrictions,
  of the neighbouring clergy also, for ever. Amongst these there is, in
  particular, one very neat pocket Hebrew Bible in 12mo., without points,
  with silver clasps to it, and bound in blue Turkey leather, in a case of
  the same materials, which she constantly carried to church with her....
  In the first leaf of all the books that had been hers, when they were
  deposited in that library," was a Latin inscription, setting forth the

  <p><i>Passage in Orosius</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 399. 536.).&mdash;I cannot
  exactly subscribe to the three propositions of <span class="sc">Mr. E.
  Thomson</span>, which he deduces from his observations on "twam tyncenum"
  in Alfred's <i>Orosius</i>. In the first place, the sentence in which the
  word <i>tyncenum</i> occurs is perfectly gratuitous on the part of
  Alfred, or whoever paraphrased Orosius in Anglo-Saxon. No such assertion
  appears in Orosius, so that we have no means of comparing it with the
  original.</p>

  <p>The occurrence, as recounted by both Orosius and Herodotus, is
  attributed to a <i>horse</i> (a sacred horse, Herod.), not to a
  <i>horseman</i>, <i>knight</i>, or <i>thane</i>. What is meant by the
  Anglo-Saxon text is, certainly, anything but clear, as it stands in
  Barrington's edition; and he himself confesses this, and does not admit
  it into his English translation.</p>

  <p>Dr. Bosworth seems to have wisely omitted the word in the second
  edition of his dictionary; and Thorpe confesses he can make nothing of
  it, in his <i>Analecta</i>. We find no such word in Cædmon, Beowulf, or
  the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i>; and the only reference made by Dr. Bosworth,
  in his first edition, is to this very place in Alfred's <i>Orosius</i>,
  in which he seems to have followed Lye.</p>

  <p>May it not have been an error in the earlier transcribers of the MS.,
  and the real word have been <i>twentigum</i>, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> he ordered his
  thane to pass over the river <i>with twenty men</i>, since the thane, by
  himself, could have been but of little use on the other side the river?
  However this may be, the fact is not historical at all, and therefore, as
  respects history, is of little consequence.</p>

  <p><i>Pugna Porcorum</i> (Vol. vii., p. 528.).&mdash;The author of this
  poem, as is generally believed (though its production has also been
  assigned to Gilbertus Cognatus or Cousin), was Joannes Leo Placentius, or
  Placentinus, of whom the following account is given in the <i>Biographie
  Universelle</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Jean-Leo Placentius ou Le Plaisant, n'est connu que comme l'auteur
  d'un petit poème <i>tautogramme</i>, genre de composition qui ne peut
  offrir que le frivole mérite de la difficulté vaincue. Né à Saint Trond,
  au pays de Liège, il fit ses études à Bois-le-Duc, dans l'école des
  Hiéronomytes; embrassa la vie religieuse, au commencement du seizième
  siècle, dans l'ordre des Dominicains, et fut envoyé à Louvain pour y
  faire son cours de théologie. Les autres circonstances de sa vie sont
  ignorées; et ce n'est que par conjecture qu'on place sa mort à l'année
  1548. On peut consulter sur cet écrivain, la <i>Bibl. Belgica</i> de
  Foppens, et les <i>Scriptores ordin. Prædicator.</i> des PP. Quétif et

  <p><i>Oaken Tombs and Effigies</i> (Vol. vii., p. 528.).&mdash;These are
  rare. Three of the latter exist at Little Horkesley, Essex. Two are
  figures of cross-legged knights in chain armour and surcoats: one is a
  female figure wimpled. They are supposed by Suckling to represent members
  of the Horkesley family, who held that manor from 1210 to 1322.</p>

  <p>Another instance is the effigy of a cross-legged knight in chain mail
  at Danbury in the same county. An account of these will be found in vol.
  iii. of Weale's <i>Architectural Papers</i>.</p>

  <p>At Ashwell, Rutland, is an effigy in wood of a cross-legged knight,
  also in chain mail, if I remember rightly. It is not quite evident, from
  the description in Weale's book, whether there are three effigies at
  Danbury or only one. Of the same material is the figure of Isabella of
  Angoulême at Fontevrault. A catalogue of these wooden effigies would be
  interesting.</p>

  <p><i>Bowyer Bible</i> (Vol. vii., <i>passim</i>).&mdash;Relative to the
  history and various possessors of this curious Bible, I find the
  following notice in <i>The Times</i>, Oct. 14, 1840:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"There is at present, in the possession of Mrs. Parker of Golden
  Square, a copy of Macklin's Bible in forty-five large volumes,
  illustrated with nearly 7000 engravings from the age of Michael Angelo to
  that of Reynolds and West. The work also contains about 200 original
  drawings or vignettes by Loutherbourg.</p>

  <p>"The prints and etchings include the works of Raffaelle, Marc Antonio,
  Albert Durer, Callot, Rembrandt, and other masters, consisting of
  representations of nearly every fact, circumstance, and object mentioned
  in the Holy Scriptures. There are, moreover, designs of trees, plants,
  flowers, quadrupeds, birds, fishes, and insects; such as, besides
  fossils, have been adduced in proof of the universal Deluge. The most
  authentic Scripture atlasses are bound up with the volumes. The Bible was
  the property of the late Mr. Bowyer the publisher, who collected and
  arranged the engravings, etchings, and drawings at great expense and
  labour; and he is said to have been engaged for upwards of thirty years
  in rendering it perfect. It was insured at the Albion Insurance Office
  for 3000<i>l.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the British Museum are several large works, particularly British
  topography, illustrated in a similar manner, and which thus contain
  materials of the rarest and most valuable description. Of these I would
  only at present mention Salmon's <i>Hertfordshire</i> illustrated by
  Baskerville, and Lysons's <i>Environs</i>, in the King's Library. A long
  list of such valuable works might be furnished from the Museum
  catalogues.</p>

  <p>One of the most laborious collectors of curious prints of every kind
  was John Bagford, whose voluminous collections are amongst the Harleian
  MSS. in many folio volumes, in which will be found illustrations of
  topography to be met with nowhere else.</p>

  <p><i>Longevity</i> (Vol. vii., pp. 358. 504.).&mdash;Our friend A.&nbsp;J. is
  certainly not one of the "remnant of true believers." By way of aiding in
  the crusade to convert him to the faith, I hereunder quote a couple of
  instances, "within the age of registers," which I trust will in some
  degree satisfy his pagan incredulity. The parish registers of the
  township of Church Minshull, in Cheshire, begin in 1561, and in the
  portion for the year 1649 appears the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Thomas Damme, of Leighton, buried the 26th of February, being of the
  age of seven score and fourteen."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This entry was made under the "Puritan dispensation," when the parish
  scribe was at any rate supposed to be an "oracle of truth." Here,
  however, is another instance, culled from the Register of Burials for the
  parish of Frodsham, also in Cheshire:</p>

  <p>I find in the pedigrees, British Museum, a "Lady Anne Grey" (daughter
  to John Lord Grey of Pirgo, brother to Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk)
  <i>married</i> to "Henry Denny of Waltham," father to the Earl of Norwich
  of that name. She was his first wife, and dying without issue, he married
  again "Lady Honora Grey, daughter of Lord Grey de Wilton;" but I scarce
  think this Lady Anne Grey could have been the maid of honour to the
  princess. The number of Greys of different stocks and branches at that
  period, are beyond counting or distinguishing from each other, and yet
  the fall of a queen's maid of honour should be <!-- Page 608 --><span

  Isabella Markham, one of the six ladies, married Sir John Harington
  himself.</p>

  <p>On referring to Lodge's <i>Illustrations</i>, I find the Lord John
  Grey one of those noblemen appointed to attend Queen Elizabeth on her
  <i>entrée</i> from Hatfield to London on her accession, so that his
  daughter may well have been one of her maids of honour; yet from
  comparison of dates I think she can scarce have been the wife of Henry
  Denny.</p>

  <p><i>Sir G. Browne, Bart.</i> (Vol. vii., p. 528.).&mdash;The
  particulars given by <span class="sc">Newbury</span>, while introducing
  his Query, are extremely vague and inaccurate. In the first place, the
  individual he styles <i>Sir</i> George Browne, <i>Bart.</i>, was in
  reality simple George Browne, <i>Esq.</i>, of Caversham, Oxon, and
  Wickham, Kent. This gentleman, who would have been a valuable acquisition
  to any nascent colony, married Elizabeth (<i>not</i> Eleanor), second
  daughter of Sir Richard Blount, of Maple Durham, and had by her nineteen
  children, pretty evenly divided as to sex: for I read that of the
  daughters, three at least died young; other three became nuns and one
  married &mdash;&mdash; Yates, Esq., a Berkshire gentleman. Of the sons,
  three, as <span class="sc">Newbury</span> relates, fell gloriously
  fighting for Charles, their sovereign. Neither of these latter were
  married: indeed, the only sons who ventured at all into the bonds of
  wedlock were George, the heir, and John, a younger brother. George
  married Mary Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Francis Englefield, Knt., a
  Popish recusant, and left two daughters, his co-heiresses. John, his
  brother, created a baronet May 19th, 1665, married Mrs. Bradley, a widow,
  and had issue three sons and three daughters. The sons, Anthony, John,
  and George, inherited the baronetcy in succession, the two former dying
  bachelors: the third son, Sir George, married his sister-in-law, Gertrude
  Morley, and left three sons, the first of whom, Sir John, succeeded his
  father; and with him the baronetcy became dormant, if not indeed
  extinct.</p>

  Elizabeth, died on the 4th of February, and was interred on the 6th of
  March, 1592 (Old Style), in Ashley Church, in Staffordshire. The style
  most probably led Dugdale into the error noticed by your learned
  correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Foss</span>, in his last communication
  to "N. &amp; Q.," relative to the probate of Sir Gilbert Gerard's will. I
  beg to forward you an extract taken from the Parish Register of Ashley,
  which, <!-- Page 609 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page609"></a>{609}</span> it will be seen, not only records the
  burial, but likewise, rather unusually, the precise day of his death, a
  little more than a month intervening between the two events, which
  possibly might be accounted for. On a careful examination of Sir
  Gilbert's tomb, I did not find (which agrees with Dugdale) any epitaph
  thereon,&mdash;a somewhat remarkable circumstance, inasmuch as Sir Thomas
  Gerard (Sir Gilbert Gerard's eldest son and heir, who was created Baron
  Gerard, of Gerard's Bromley, where his father had built a splendid
  mansion, a view of which is in Plot's <i>History of Staffordshire</i>,
  page 103., not a vestige of which beyond the gateway is now standing) is
  said by the Staffordshire historians to have erected a monument to the
  memory of his father at great expense; a drawing of which is given by
  Garner in his <i>Natural History of Staffordshire</i>, p. 120., with a
  copious description of the tomb.</p>

  I saw the work entitled&mdash;subsequently a Puritan preacher), is, I
  imagine, identical with Thomas Gage, minister of the Gospel at Deal in
  Kent, whom your correspondent A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;R. inquires about, p. 291. If so, he
  became chaplain to Lord Fairfax, and, according to Macaulay, was not
  unlikely to have married some dependent connexion of that family.</p>

  <p><i>Marriage in High Life</i> (Vol. vi., p. 359.).&mdash;I have often
  heard a similar story, from an old relation of mine with whom I lived
  when a girl; and she had heard it from her father,&mdash;which would
  carry the time of its occurrence back to the date 1740, named by your
  correspondent. My informant's father knew the parties, and I have
  repeatedly heard the name of the bridegroom; but whether Wilbraham or
  Swetenham, I do not now remember. Both Wilbrahams and Swetenhams are old
  Cheshire families, and have intermarried. I am almost certain a Wilbraham
  was the hero of the story. I have had the house pointed out to me where
  he lived, and it was not above a couple of hours' drive from Chester,
  whither we were going in the old-fashioned way of carriage-conveyance. I
  am sure he was not a peer, though, if a Wilbraham, he might be related to
  the late (first) Lord Skelmersdale.</p>

  <p>There is one other little circumstance, which the reference to those
  former times has reminded me of,&mdash;the pronunciation of the word
  <i>obliged</i> (as in the Prologue to the <i>Satires</i>, where Pope
  says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6">"By flatterers besieged,</p>
      <p>And so obliging that he ne'er obliged),</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>which the old lady that I have referred to, maintained was the proper
  pronunciation for <i>obleege</i>, to confer a favour; whereas the harsher
  sound, to <i>oblige</i>, was discriminatively reserved for the
  equivalent, to compel. She was a well-educated woman, and had associated
  with the good society of London in her youth; and she always complained
  of the want of taste and judgment shown by the younger generation, in
  pronouncing the same word, with two distinct meanings, alike in both
  cases.</p>

      <p>What wouldst thou do, if thou couldst see the jester himself?</p>

      <p>He left many a brother behind. We are great fools</p>
      <p>In thinking that we are the greatest sages:</p>
      <p>Therefore laugh at thyself, as this sheet represents thyself."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>From the orthography, I do not think that the lines are much anterior
  to the beginning of the eighteenth century. The names of the artist will
  be the safest guides for discovering the date of the print.</p>

  <p>The reputation which Mr. Finlay has acquired by his <i>History of
  Greece</i>, and his <i>Greece under the Romans</i>, will unquestionably
  be increased by his newly published <i>History of the Byzantine Empire
  from <span class="sc">dccxvi.</span> to <span
  class="sc">mlvii.</span></i> The subject is one of great interest to the
  scholar; and the manner in which Mr. Finlay has traced the progress of
  the eastern Roman empire through an eventful period of three centuries
  and a half, and while doing so enriched his pages with constant reference
  to the original historians, has certainly enabled him to accomplish the
  object which he has avowedly had in view, namely, that of making his work
  serve not only as a popular history, but also as an index for scholars
  who may be more familiar with classic literature than with the Byzantine
  writers.</p>

  becoming the Patrons of the <i>Photographic Society</i>.</p>

  <p>The <i>Camden Society</i> is about to put to press a work which will
  be of great value to our topographical writers, as well as to historians
  generally, namely, <i>The Extent of the Estates of the Hospitalers in
  England, taken under the direction of Prior Philip de Thame</i>, <span
  class="sc">a.d.</span> 1338. The original MS. is at Malta; and though the
  transcript of it was made by a most competent hand, we have reason to
  believe that our correspondent at La Valetta (W.&nbsp;W.) would be doing good
  service both to the Society and to the world of letters, and one which
  would be most acceptable to the Transcriber, if he could find it
  convenient to revise the proof sheets with the original document.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>Cyclopædia
  Bibliographica, a Library Manual of Theological and General
  Literature.</i> Part IX. of this useful Library Companion extends from
  <i>Göthe</i> to <i>Matthew Henry</i>.&mdash;<i>Reynard the Fox, after the
  German Version of Göthe, with Illustrations, by J. Wolf.</i> Part VI.
  Contains Chap. VI. The Relapse.&mdash;Messrs. Longman have added to their
  <i>Traveller's Library</i> (in two parts) an interesting and cleverly
  written account of our <i>Coal Mines, and those who live in them</i>,
  which gives a graphic picture of the places and persons to whom we are
  all for so many months indebted for our greatest comfort.&mdash;Mr. Bohn
  continues his good work of supplying excellent books at moderate prices.
  We are this month indebted to him for publishing in his <i>Scientific
  Library</i> the third volume of Miss Ross' excellent translation of
  Humboldt's <i>Personal Narrative of his Travels to the Equinoctial
  Regions of America</i>, which is enriched with a very copious index. In
  his <i>Classical Library</i> he has given us <i>Translations of Terence
  and Phædrus</i>; and in his <i>Antiquarian Library</i>, the second volume
  of what, in spite of the laches pointed out by one of our correspondents,
  we must pronounce a most useful work for the mere English reader, the
  second volume of Mr. Riley's translation of <i>Roger de Hoveden's Annals
  of English History</i>, which completes the work. Probably, however, the
  volume which Mr. Bohn has just published in his <i>Standard Library</i>
  is the one which will excite most interest. It is issued as a
  continuation of Coxe's <i>History of the House of Austria</i>, and
  consists (for the most part) of a translation of Count Hartig's
  <i>Genesis of the Revolution in Austria</i>.</p>

  <p><b>SOME ACCOUNT</b> of DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE in ENGLAND, from the
  Conquest to the end of the Thirteenth Century, with numerous
  Illustrations of Existing Remains from Original Drawings. By T. HUDSON
  TURNER.</p>

  <p>"What Horace Walpole attempted, and what Sir Charles Lock Eastlake has
  done for oil-painting&mdash;elucidated its history and traced its
  progress in England by means of the records of expenses and mandates of
  the successive Sovereigns of the realm&mdash;Mr. Hudson Turner has now
  achieved for Domestic Architecture in this country during the twelfth and
  thirteenth centuries."&mdash;<i>Architect.</i></p>

  <p>"The writer of the present volume ranks among the most intelligent of
  the craft, and a careful perusal of its contents will convince the reader
  of the enormous amount of labour bestowed on its minutest details, as
  well as the discriminating judgment presiding over the general
  arrangement."&mdash;<i>Morning Chronicle.</i></p>

  <p>"The book of which the title is given above is one of the very few
  attempts that have been made in this country to treat this interesting
  subject in anything more than a superficial manner.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Turner exhibits much learning and research, and he has
  consequently laid before the reader much interesting information. It is a
  book that was wanted, and that affords us some relief from the mass of
  works on Ecclesiastical Architecture with which of late years we have
  been deluged.</p>

  <p>"The work is well illustrated throughout with wood-engravings of the
  more interesting remains, and will prove a valuable addition to the
  antiquary's library."&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>"It is as a text-book on the social comforts and condition of the
  Squires and Gentry of England during the twelfth and thirteenth
  centuries, that the leading value of Mr. Turner's present publication
  will be found to consist.</p>

  <p>"Turner's handsomely-printed volume is profusely illustrated with
  careful woodcuts of all important existing remains, made from drawings by
  Mr. Blore and Mr. Twopeny."&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>
